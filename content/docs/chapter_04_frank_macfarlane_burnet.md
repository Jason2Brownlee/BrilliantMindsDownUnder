# Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet

> Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet's pioneering research on acquired immunological tolerance paved the way for advances in organ transplantation and our understanding of the immune system.

## Introduction and Overview of the Field

Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, an Australian virologist and immunologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960 for his groundbreaking discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. He shared this honor with British biologist Peter Medawar, who independently made the same discovery.

Immunology, the study of the immune system, is a crucial field in medicine. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against infectious agents and other harmful substances. Understanding how the immune system functions is essential for developing treatments for a wide range of diseases, from infections to autoimmune disorders and cancer.

One of the most significant challenges in immunology has been understanding how the immune system distinguishes between "self" and "non-self." This is critical because the immune system must be able to recognize and attack foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria while avoiding damage to the body's own tissues. Burnet's work on immunological tolerance provided a key piece of this puzzle.

Immunological tolerance refers to the immune system's ability to "learn" to accept certain foreign substances without mounting an immune response. This is particularly important in the context of organ transplantation, where the immune system must be prevented from attacking the transplanted organ. Prior to Burnet's discovery, organ transplantation was virtually impossible due to the immune system's tendency to reject foreign tissue.

## Biographical Profile

Frank Macfarlane Burnet was born on September 3, 1899, in Traralgon, a small town in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia. He was the second of seven children born to Scottish parents, Frank Burnet, a bank manager, and Hadassah Pollock Burnet.

Growing up in rural Australia, young Frank developed a keen interest in the natural world. He was an avid collector of beetles and butterflies, a passion that would later translate into his meticulous approach to scientific research. Burnet's early education took place in country state schools, where he excelled academically.

In 1917, Burnet began his tertiary education at the University of Melbourne, initially studying medicine. However, his studies were interrupted by the First World War. In 1918, he enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps, serving briefly before the war ended.

Returning to his studies, Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree in 1922, topping his class. His academic prowess earned him a Rhodes Scholarship, which he used to attend the University of London, earning a Ph.D. in 1928.

Burnet's early life and education in Australia laid the foundation for his future scientific career. His rural upbringing instilled in him a lifelong love of nature and a keen sense of observation, while his medical training provided him with the skills and knowledge to pursue a career in biomedical research.

## Academic and Professional Journey

After completing his MBBS at the University of Melbourne in 1922, Burnet took up a position as a resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital. In 1923, he joined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Melbourne, which would become his scientific home for the rest of his career.

At WEHI, Burnet initially focused on bacteriology and virology. He made significant contributions to the understanding of viruses, including the isolation of the influenza virus in 1932. In 1934, he was appointed as the assistant director of WEHI, and in 1944, he became the director, a position he held until his retirement in 1965.

Throughout his career, Burnet held numerous academic positions in Australia. He served as a professor of experimental medicine at the University of Melbourne from 1944 to 1965 and was a research professor of microbiology at the University of Melbourne from 1965 to 1978.

Burnet's research journey was marked by several key collaborations and mentorships. One of his most significant mentors was W.J. Penfold, who directed WEHI from 1926 to 1937. Penfold encouraged Burnet to pursue his interest in virology and provided him with the resources and support to do so.

Another important collaboration was with Peter Medawar, with whom Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize. Although they worked independently, Burnet and Medawar's research converged on the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance, leading to a fruitful exchange of ideas between the two scientists.

## Specific Contributions to the Field

Burnet's Nobel Prize-winning discovery of acquired immunological tolerance was the culmination of years of research into the immune system. In the late 1940s, Burnet was studying the phenomenon of "self-recognition" in the immune system - how the body learns to distinguish its own tissues from foreign substances.

Burnet hypothesized that the immune system learns to recognize "self" during embryonic development. He proposed that during this critical period, the immune system is exposed to the body's own tissues and learns to tolerate them. This learning process, he suggested, is irreversible - once the immune system has learned to tolerate a substance, it will continue to do so throughout life.

To test this hypothesis, Burnet and his team conducted experiments on mice. They injected mouse embryos with cells from a different strain of mice, then observed whether the mice would later reject tissue grafts from the same strain. Remarkably, they found that the mice tolerated the grafts, indicating that they had developed immunological tolerance to the foreign cells.

This discovery was a major breakthrough in immunology. It explained how the immune system learns to tolerate the body's own tissues and why it does not normally attack them. It also had significant implications for organ transplantation. If immunological tolerance could be induced in a patient receiving a transplant, the immune system would be less likely to reject the foreign tissue.

Burnet's work on tolerance also led him to develop the "clonal selection theory" of antibody production. According to this theory, each antibody-producing cell (B cell) is specific for a particular antigen. When a B cell encounters its specific antigen, it is stimulated to divide and produce large numbers of identical antibodies. This theory, which was later confirmed experimentally, is a cornerstone of modern immunology.

## Impact of Their Work

The impact of Burnet's discovery of acquired immunological tolerance cannot be overstated. It revolutionized our understanding of the immune system and paved the way for major advances in medicine.

One of the most significant applications of Burnet's work has been in the field of organ transplantation. Prior to the discovery of immunological tolerance, organ transplantation was virtually impossible due to the immune system's tendency to reject foreign tissue. However, Burnet's work suggested that if tolerance could be induced in a transplant recipient, rejection could be prevented.

This insight led to the development of immunosuppressive drugs, which are used to suppress the immune system in transplant patients. These drugs have made organ transplantation a routine medical procedure, saving countless lives worldwide. Today, transplantation of kidneys, livers, hearts, and other organs is commonplace, thanks in large part to Burnet's pioneering research.

Beyond transplantation, Burnet's work has had a profound impact on our understanding of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, leading to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Burnet's research helped explain why the immune system sometimes fails to distinguish "self" from "non-self," providing a foundation for the development of treatments for these diseases.

Burnet's clonal selection theory also had far-reaching implications. It provided a framework for understanding how the immune system responds to pathogens and how vaccines work. This understanding has led to the development of numerous vaccines that have saved millions of lives, including vaccines for polio, measles, and influenza.

Today, research in immunology continues to build on the foundation laid by Burnet. Scientists are exploring new ways to manipulate the immune system to fight cancer, developing more effective vaccines, and working to better understand and treat autoimmune diseases. None of this would be possible without Burnet's groundbreaking discoveries.

## Connection to Australia

Throughout his life and career, Burnet maintained a strong connection to Australia. Born and raised in Victoria, he conducted nearly all of his groundbreaking research at Australian institutions, primarily at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) in Melbourne.

Burnet's association with WEHI began in 1923 and continued until his death in 1985. He served as the institute's director from 1944 to 1965, during which time he transformed it into a world-leading center for medical research. Under his leadership, WEHI made significant contributions to the fields of virology, immunology, and cancer research.

Beyond his research, Burnet played an active role in shaping science policy in Australia. He served as a member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Advisory Council from 1933 to 1944 and was the chairman of the Australian National Capital Planning Committee for the Australian National University from 1949 to 1957.

Burnet's contributions to Australian science were recognized with numerous national honors. In 1958, he was named Australian of the Year, and in 1960, he was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). He was also a recipient of the Crafoord Prize (1981), Royal Medal (1947), and Copley Medal (1959), among many others.

In Melbourne, Burnet is remembered through the Burnet Institute, an independent medical research institute named in his honor. The institute, founded in 1986, focuses on the prevention, detection, and treatment of infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries.

Burnet's legacy also lives on through the numerous Australian scientists he mentored and inspired. Many of his students and colleagues went on to make significant contributions to immunology and other fields of medical research. Today, Australia continues to be a leader in biomedical research, thanks in no small part to the foundation laid by Burnet.
