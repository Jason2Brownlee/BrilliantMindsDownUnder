As a child, Coetzee was exposed to a wide range of literary works, from the classics of Western literature to the emerging voices of African and South African writers.

Despite the oppressive and segregated reality of apartheid South Africa, Coetzee's parents instilled in him a sense of justice and compassion for others.

Through Paul's struggles and triumphs, Coetzee offers a poignant and insightful portrait of life in contemporary Australia.

Similarly, in "The Childhood of Jesus," Coetzee explores themes of exile, belonging, and the search for meaning in a strange and unfamiliar world.
