# Sir John Cornforth

> Sir John Cornforth's Nobel Prize-winning work on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions uncovered the precise three-dimensional structures of molecules involved in enzymatic processes, revolutionizing our understanding of biochemistry and paving the way for targeted drug design.

## Introduction and Overview of the Field

Sir John Cornforth, an Australian-born chemist, was awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Vladimir Prelog, for his groundbreaking work on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of chemistry and laid the foundation for a deeper understanding of the complex world of biochemical processes.

Stereochemistry, the branch of chemistry that deals with the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules, plays a crucial role in determining the properties and functions of chemical compounds. In the context of biochemistry, the stereochemistry of molecules is particularly important, as it governs how enzymes, the biological catalysts that drive chemical reactions in living organisms, interact with their substrates.

Enzymes are highly specific in their actions, and their ability to catalyze reactions depends on the precise three-dimensional structure of both the enzyme and the substrate molecule. A slight change in the stereochemistry of a molecule can have a profound impact on its biological activity, making the study of stereochemistry essential for understanding the intricate workings of life at the molecular level.

Prior to Cornforth's work, the stereochemical details of enzyme-catalyzed reactions remained largely elusive. Scientists knew that enzymes were capable of catalyzing a wide range of chemical transformations with remarkable specificity and efficiency, but the precise mechanisms by which they achieved this feat were poorly understood. Cornforth's pioneering research shed new light on this fundamental aspect of biochemistry, revealing the critical role of stereochemistry in enzyme function and paving the way for a new era of scientific discovery.

## Biographical Profile

John Warcup Cornforth was born on September 7, 1917, in Sydney, Australia. From an early age, Cornforth displayed a keen interest in science and a remarkable aptitude for chemistry. Despite facing the significant challenge of deafness, which he had struggled with since childhood, Cornforth's passion for learning and his determination to succeed propelled him forward in his academic pursuits.

Cornforth's early education took place in Sydney, where he attended Sydney Boys High School. It was during these formative years that his interest in chemistry blossomed, and he began to lay the foundation for his future scientific career. Cornforth's deafness, which had been present since infancy due to a genetic condition, posed a significant obstacle to his studies. However, he refused to let this challenge hold him back and developed a deep sense of self-reliance and resourcefulness that would serve him well throughout his life.

Despite the difficulties he faced, Cornforth excelled academically, demonstrating a particular aptitude for science and mathematics. His teachers and mentors quickly recognized his potential and encouraged him to pursue his passion for chemistry. With their support and his own determination, Cornforth emerged as one of the top students in his class, setting the stage for a brilliant career in scientific research.

## Academic and Professional Journey

Cornforth's academic journey began at the University of Sydney, where he enrolled in 1934 to pursue his undergraduate studies in chemistry. He quickly distinguished himself as an exceptional student, earning his Bachelor of Science degree with first-class honors in 1937. Cornforth's outstanding performance earned him the University Medal, the highest academic honor bestowed upon undergraduate students at the University of Sydney.

Encouraged by his success and eager to explore the world of chemistry, Cornforth decided to continue his studies at the graduate level. He remained at the University of Sydney, where he undertook research in organic chemistry under the guidance of Professor Francis Lions. In 1938, Cornforth completed his Master of Science degree, further cementing his reputation as a talented and promising young chemist.

Seeking to expand his horizons and gain exposure to the international scientific community, Cornforth decided to pursue his doctoral studies abroad. In 1939, he was awarded a prestigious scholarship to attend the University of Oxford in England, where he began his research under the supervision of renowned chemist Sir Robert Robinson. However, the outbreak of World War II soon interrupted his studies, as Cornforth felt compelled to contribute to the war effort.

During the war years, Cornforth put his scientific expertise to use at the Medical Research Council, where he worked on the development of penicillin, the first antibiotic to be widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections. His contributions to this vital research helped to revolutionize medicine and saved countless lives.

After the war, Cornforth returned to Oxford to complete his doctoral studies. In 1946, he was awarded his D.Phil. in chemistry for his research on the synthesis of sterols, a class of organic compounds that includes cholesterol and other important biological molecules. This work laid the foundation for his later groundbreaking research on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

Following his doctoral studies, Cornforth embarked on a distinguished career in scientific research. He held positions at the National Institute for Medical Research in London and later at the University of Warwick, where he continued to make seminal contributions to the field of organic chemistry. Throughout his career, Cornforth's work was characterized by a deep commitment to scientific rigor, innovative thinking, and a desire to push the boundaries of knowledge.

## Specific Contributions to the Field

Cornforth's most significant contribution to the field of chemistry, and the work that earned him the Nobel Prize, was his pioneering research on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This groundbreaking work shed new light on the precise three-dimensional structures of molecules involved in enzymatic processes and revolutionized our understanding of how enzymes function at the molecular level.

One of Cornforth's key achievements was his synthesis of the enzyme-bound intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a vital component of cell membranes and a precursor to many important biological molecules, including hormones and bile acids. The biosynthesis of cholesterol is a complex process that involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, each of which is highly specific and tightly regulated.

By synthesizing the enzyme-bound intermediate in this process, Cornforth was able to elucidate the precise stereochemical details of this critical step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This achievement not only advanced our understanding of this specific biochemical pathway but also provided valuable insights into the general principles governing enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

To accomplish this feat, Cornforth developed novel techniques for studying the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. These techniques involved the use of isotopically labeled compounds, which allowed him to track the movement of individual atoms during the course of a reaction. By carefully analyzing the stereochemical outcome of these reactions, Cornforth was able to deduce the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-bound intermediates and gain insight into the mechanism of enzyme catalysis.

Cornforth's work laid the foundation for the development of new methods for studying enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which have since become standard tools in the field of biochemistry. His research also paved the way for the rational design of enzyme inhibitors, which have become important targets for drug discovery in the treatment of a wide range of diseases.

In addition to his work on cholesterol biosynthesis, Cornforth made significant contributions to the study of other important biological molecules, including penicillins, carbohydrates, and amino acids. His research helped to elucidate the stereochemical details of the biosynthesis and metabolism of these compounds, further advancing our understanding of the complex chemistry of life.
